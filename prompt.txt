Please translate the following English text into Spanish and then format the output as follows to help with learning Spanish:

1. don't use any markup or markdown just plain text.
2. Remove any timestamps from the text.
3. Divide the text into small chunks of 3 to 5 words.
4. The first line of each chunk should be the Spanish translation.
5. The second line should be "(pause: 1)".
6. The third line should be the original English text.
8. The fourth line should be "(pause: 1)".
9. Continue this pattern for the entire text.

The goal is to make it easier to learn Spanish by breaking the text into manageable parts.

For example:

Input: "At some point, you want to overtake."

Desired Output: En alg√∫n momento
(pause: 1)
At some point
(pause: 1)
quieres superar
(pause: 1)
you want to overtake
(pause: 1)
